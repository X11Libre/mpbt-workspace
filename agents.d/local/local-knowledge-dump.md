## Local knowledge dump

This directory (`agents.d/local/`) is a **local dumping ground** for
insights, discoveries, quirks, and conventions learned during agent
sessions — anything that doesn't yet belong in the structured
`project/`, `starfleet/`, or eventual `xlibre/` taxonomies.

### Rules

1. **Dump first, sort later.** If you discover something during a
   session that is worth remembering, create or append to a file here
   immediately. Don't worry about where it should ultimately live.

2. **No cross-ship guarantees.** Other ships in the fleet may write
   here too, but there is no ordering, deduplication, or review
   process. Treat this as scratch space.

3. **Promotion path.** When a local insight proves itself stable
   (survived multiple sessions, referenced from other fragments), it
   should be moved to the appropriate taxonomy directory:
   - `agents.d/starfleet-instructions/` — fleet coordination, comms, workflow
   - `agents.d/xlibre/`   — mpbt-workspace, build system, project rules
   - `agents.d/xlibre/`    — X server, drivers, protocol (future)

4. **On `mtx/agent-config`, auto-commit applies** — changes here are
   committed and pushed automatically per the auto-commit policy.

## Automatic feedback loop

After each (non-trivial) task, check your session for lessons learned and
add new entries here in the agents.d/local/ directory.

If you needed extra code (scripts, etc) for driving existing starfleet commands
(eg. github functions), analyze whether starfleetctl could use new commands
or options, so we need less extra scripting around it in the future, and create
dashboard tasks in the starfleet section.
